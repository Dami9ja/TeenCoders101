                <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                <img src="images/advance.jpg" class="pictures left-pictures" />
                <p>TeenCoders started in Port Harcourt in September, 2015, as an effort to help a little girl, Ms. Amarachi, a primary 5 pupil, have hands-on computer experience.</p>
                <p class="clear">One day, when Ms. Amarachi returned from school, Mr. Anietie, asked a series of computer related questions, and she answered excellently well, and with ease. But when he brought out his laptop and asked her to use, she was scared and did not even know how to hold or use the mouse. The next day, Mr. Anietie invited 20 other children in the neighbourhood(Rumuomasi,PH), and the same thing occured - excellent head knowledge, and no hands-on experience.</p>
                <p>This prompted Mr. Anietie to approach some people for assistance - his boss, Mr. Ojo Akin-Longe of TND Press offered an office space (a container space at TND, 34 Old Aba Road, PH) and a laptop. Some friends volunteered to help in teaching (Mr. Dan, Mr. Promise, Mr. Godswill, students from AISEC Uniport, Mr. Kenneth, Mr. Jude).</p>
                <p>Every Saturday, Mr. Anietie will take these children to the office space to take lessons on computing and programming.</p>
                <p>By March 2016, Mr. Anietie resigned, and with his savings registered TeenCoders with the Coperate Affairs Commission (CAC). The first school to adopt the TeenCoders Club was Akon Education Centre in Woji, PH.</p>
                <p>The Company grew very fast.</p>
                <br>

                <div class="overflow">
                    <p><strong>(2016)</strong> The team went to Abuja for a program organized in  partnership with the Office of the Wife of the President, and the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC). During this program, TeenCoders trained more than 100 girls on coding in one week.</p>
                <p><strong>(2017)</strong> By September, branch was open in Akwa Ibom State.</p>
                <p><strong>(2018)</strong> April, TeenCoders enter into partnership with a Lagos-based Company to set up a franchise in Lagos.</p>
                <p><strong>(2019)</strong> TeenCoders' student, Master Okaro Udugba, a 9 year old, Grade 4 pupil of Pleroma International School, Woji, won the MTN Hackathon Competition. November, 2019, TeenCoders organized and sponsored the 1st ever coding    competition in PH for Primary and Secondary Schools. Laptops and scholarships were awarded to the best students.</p>
                <p><strong>(2020)</strong> March, TeenCoders started a branch in Calabar. Presently, TeenCoders has more than 50 partner schools in Nigeria, and the number of students taught weekly has exceeded 5,000.</p>
                <p>The goal is to make coding fun and easy for children to learn and develop with.</p>
